       ______________________________________________________________
     
   2.1. What is Majik?
          Majik is a project to create an online role-playing environment
          set in a complete and ever-evolving medieval fantasy world with
          the help of modern 3D-technology.
          
   2.2. What is a MURPE?
          MURPE stands for Multi-User Role-Playing Environment.
          
   2.3. What is Majik 3D?
          Majik 3D is the fifth, and hopefully final, distinguishable
          incarnation of Majik. All of Majik's [46]predecessors have been
          essentially MUDs, the fourth being a roguelike + MUD synthesis,
          but Majik 3D is a 3-dimensional RPG that uses a real
          hardware-accelerated 3D engine. At the moment Majik 3D is under
          heavy development. The source code for some of Majik 3D's
          predecessors is available from:
          [47]ftp://ftp.majik3d.org/attic/ - build your own MUD or
          multiplayer roguelike! :)
          
   2.4. When will Majik 3D be open to the public?
          Unknown. It will probably take months, even years. Look at our
          [48]milestone plan to get some idea where we are going and
          where we are within the next few months.
          
   2.5. Who are the developers of Majik 3D?
          The people responsible for the base code of Majik 3D are listed
          below:
          
          [49]Tommi "Namhas" Leino ([50]namhas@majik3d.org)
          [51]Jari "Dazzt" Saukkonen ([52]dazzt@majik3d.org)
          [53]Atte "Yorkaturr" Koivula ([54]yorkaturr@majik3d.org)
          [55]Otso "Harum" Mäkinen ([56]harum@majik3d.org)
          
          There are also [57]numerous designers who are designing the
          world among other things, and doing miscellanious things apart
          from coding.
          
   2.6. Does Majik 3D have a homepage?
          Yes, the URL for Majik's homepage is:
          [58]http://www.majik3d.org
          
   2.7. Do you need my help?
          Yes, certainly. This is a non-profit volunteer-driven project
          where the developers work only when they have time and on
          things they have interest into. Approximated time spent on the
          project by a volunteer is only few hours in a week (or even
          less!) and compare that to a person working on a project for a
          living, doing work from 8 to 12 hours in a day with benefits of
          sitting at the same board with other developers and being able
          to know exactly what to do next and how and doing it even if it
          is not so fun.
          
          Thus, if one does 3 hours in a week as a volunteer we would
          need 13-14 developers for one person doing 8 hours work in a
          day for a living. Then as we add those other benefits it can be
          that for one we need 20, and a project like this certainly
          needs more than one or two developers! Remember also that the
          1:20 ratio is only true if all of our volunteers are as skilled
          as would be in the commercial project.
          
          You can help the project in many ways. Our primary need is of
          skilled programmers, productive world designers and those with
          skill in computer graphics, 3D, 2D or with pen and paper (see
          our [59]art gallery). It is also very possible to help the
          project by suggesting ideas, sending bug reports, fixing bugs
          or porting the client to new platforms (show us that there is
          some benefit for the client being Open Source!), adding a link
          to Majik from your homepages or wherever applicable (see our
          [60]banner - draw a better one!) and by for example correcting
          the many spelling mistakes in these pages. Use your
          imagination.
          
          And remember, when you have found a bug, do report it
          immediately and do not wait that someone else will report it.
          They may not. For a while we had our Win32 port of the client
          in a condition that it didn't work at all (there were files
          missing), about 500 users downloaded the client and only one of
          them dare to report such a fatal bug when a week has passed
          already.
          
          In any case, the address is [61]majik@majik3d.org.
          
   2.8. What is the difference between WorldForge and Majik?
          WorldForge: WorldForge's approach is not to create a single
          game, but instead a flexible framework that can support a
          variety of different kinds of servers, clients, rule sets,
          worlds, and graphical "looks".
          
          Majik: The Majik Project strives to create not a system for
          creating roleplaying worlds, which is what WorldForge aims at,
          but is a concentrated effort to create one complete and
          evolving roleplaying world.
          
   2.9. How much will Majik cost to play, or will it be free?
          Majik is totally free of charge until it is so big that we must
          distribute it using CDs and at that point the medium will be
          the only factor determining the price.
          
   2.10. Why did you choose 3D, aren't there easier alternatives?
          A very common question. It seems almost everyone thinks that
          making a complete 3D world is much more difficult and
          time-consuming than a 2D world, but in fact it is quite the
          opposite. In a 2D client, every tile, character, etc. needs to
          be drawn by a graphic artist, and the code for LOS (line of
          sight) and other such things can get rather complicated, not to
          say the code in a 3D world is especially simplistic. Majik's 3D
          client doesn't even need excessive graphics, most of them is
          done by the code itself. The screenshots available of the
          current client program are all done without any aid of a
          graphic artist. Since a 3D world can survive without a horde of
          graphic artists and is generally easier to implement, consider
          the possibilities and limitations. Which one do you prefer: to
          climb up a mountain, turn to face whatever direction and see
          for miles or to see a flat world from a constant isometric
          angle? :)
          
   2.11. Why make Majik when other, similar projects are already
          underway?
          You should rather be asking why have other projects been
          started when Majik was already being developed? The development
          of Majik begun in 1995, its only competitors at that time being
          text-based MUDs. The developers started the project because
          they wanted to make something with more depth and purpose than
          mindless monster-killing that goes on in most MUDs. The purpose
          of Majik has always been to provide an actual, working
          role-playing enviroment that would be completely
          player-controlled and self-sustaining, without the constant
          need of outside administration and control. The actions of
          players can cause significant changes in the history,
          enviroment and even geography of various areas and races,
          unlike in most MUDs where only the "gods" and implementors can
          make changes to the world. When we started Majik, there were no
          similar projects, if there would have been one, we would have
          joined the project to avoid reinventing the wheel, which seems
          to be a popular habit in the Open Source community nowadays. A
          waste of resources I would say.
          
          The recently discovered commercial game called [62]Underlight
          can be estimated to be most nearest to our project at the
          concept level (not the world), otherwise it is unique and
          easily distinguishable from our project. Tell us if there are
          others.
          
   2.12. So why won't you charge money, I really think you could!
          It would be too complicated. We would have to require the
          players to have a credit card, which many people don't have. It
          would halve our player base just because the lack of a credit
          card. There are other problems as well, such as everything
          concerning code contribution for a commercial project. The
          majority of Open Source enthusiasts would just hate Majik as a
          principle. We would also have to form a company of some sort to
          do it legally, which is not really a simple thing to do.
          
          Instead, we hope to receive donations from the players. We're
          about to establish a non-profit organization to support this
          and the alike projects. We could then, for example, give divine
          favor for the donaters and thus they would have something
          "concrete" for their money. This is, of course, a bit unfair,
          and thus the divine favor will not give any immediate advantage
          for the players, it just enhances the donater's relation with
          his/her deity with less work than those who do not donate.
          Thus, the donaters would just seem more lucky.
          
          The money received by the non-profit organization are all saved
          until needed for things such as upgrading our server, which is
          absolutely necessary as the time passes. If we then have any
          spare money left, we can use them to feed people in Majik
          conventions or otherwise support the project. The money is not
          owned by any individual.
          
   2.13. How are you going to solve the problem of troublesome players?
          We're trying to build an environment with such an atmosphere
          that there would be no place for such players, they would find
          it out themselves sooner or later. Also, there are lunatics in
          real life, why couldn't there be lunatics in Majik too? It
          could be actually fun to roleplay such cases.
          
   2.14. Does Majik have an IRC channel?
          Yes, channel #majik at IRCnet, but it is not so popular. The
          right way to get in contact with Majik is to send mail, but
          there is also one of Majik 3D's precedessors online, the Majik
          3. It is a telnetable MUD which is nowadays online only for
          chatting. You can connect to it by telnetting
          [63]majik.majik3d.org 7600. Of course, you might also find us
          idling in the Majik 3D.
       ______________________________________________________________
     
   3.1. Where can I get the client?
          Right now there is no client you could use for playing Majik.
          However, if you want to participate in bug-testing,
          portability-fixing, the development, or just want to see how it
          looks right now, you can download the client from our
          [64]download page.
          
   3.2. What platforms does the client support?
          The client is primarily developed under Linux and it is ported
          to Win32 (95/98/NT), IRIX and Solaris. In the future it will be
          hopefully ported to all the architectures and operating systems
          supported by [65]The Mesa 3-D graphics library.
          
   3.3. Is the client's source code available?
          Yes, it is available under the GNU Public License from our FTP
          server. To us it seems beneficial that other people are able to
          port the client freely to all systems and make small changes
          and corrections without our constant intervention.
          
          The server's source code, on the other hand, is not, and will
          not be, available to the public, because having it available
          without control wouldn't have any apparent gain (unlike with
          the client) and it would, with a time, lead into unnecessary
          fragmentation and thus make it harder to maintain centralized
          development with a clear, consistent goal. This arrangement
          doesn't restrict you in any way, if you want to play with the
          source, you just have to send us mail, join the development
          team and have full access to our CVS tree.
          
   3.4. Does the client have any special hardware requirements?
          If you want to use the best detail level you will need a 3D
          card, otherwise the graphics will be just too slow. However, it
          is possible to reduce the detail levels so it is actually
          possible to run Majik on systems without additional 3D
          hardware.
          
   3.5. What do these version numbers mean?
          (major version).(minor version).(patch level), e.g. 0.3.2.
          
          A first major version is released when we aren't pre anything
          and later when we can say that the client isn't at all the same
          as was the last major release. A minor version is then released
          when a milestone has been achieved and a patch level is
          released when a minor correction or bug fix has been applied to
          last minor release. Your client's major and minor version
          numbers must match the server or otherwise you are kicked out.
          The server doesn't care about the patch level.
          
   3.6. What is the latest version available for download?
          The latest version is 0.3.0.
          
   3.7. I have found a bug, what should I do?
          If it doesn't appear in the FAQ's section 4, report it
          immediately to [66]majik@majik3d.org. Thank you.
       ______________________________________________________________
     
   4.1. The client crashes when pressing OK in the about box.
          We don't have any idea why it isn't working. It works fine in
          Linux and other Unix versions, but it just happen to crash in
          Win32, even though it should be using exactly the same code.
          Perhaps this can imply something of stability of the operating
          system you are using. To solve this problem, you must either
          wait for us to figure it out or if in hurry, install Linux.
          
   4.2. The Win32 executable reports missing WS2_32.DLL
          Your Winsock version is too old or it is missing completely.
          Get a new Winsock version from:
          [67]http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuadm
          intools/s_wunetworkingtools/w95sockets2/default.asp.
          
   4.3. I got "unsupported special key" when trying to move.
          You're trying to move without your num lock key turned on, or
          you're trying to move using arrow keys. To solve the problem
          you must either turn your num lock on and use numpad to move or
          wait until we make it work in any case.
          
   4.4. I have problems with connecting to the server.
          You may have an old IP address in the majik3d.ini (Win32) or
          majikrc (Unix) configuration file. The right one is:
          195.74.0.76. A better way would be to use the majik.majik3d.org
          address instead, because it will be the same even if the IP
          address changes in the future. The problems can also happen
          when a link to Majik is temporarily down or the server has been
          crashed. In the latter case it should come up automatically
          after a few minutes of waiting.
          
   4.5. All I see is a blank screen and nothing happens.
          Turn your num lock on and try to move using the numpad. It
          should be enough to just hit one of '4', '6', '8' or '2' and
          the landscape should appear. This is because the code has
          calculated height for the landscape at the spot you are
          standing before the landscape has been constructed and thus you
          end up below it.
          
   4.6. When compiling the sources, I got errors of missing header files.
          You apparently haven't properly installed all the libraries
          required to compile the sources. See the README.* files that
          came with the sources for a list of needed libraries.
