       ______________________________________________________________
     
   2.1. What is Majik?
          Majik is an Internet-based role-playing environment. It is
          essentially unique in it's genre, as it is more influenced by
          fantasy literature and real-life role-playing games such as
          AD&D and Rolemaster than typical multiplayer games such as MUDs
          or Roguelikes. Majik has gone through almost every possible
          cosmetic appearance, it has been telnet based, a Roguelike,
          briefly 2D graphical, and now, finally, 3D.
          
   2.2. What is a MURPE?
          MURPE stands for Multi-User Role-Playing Environment.
          
   2.3. What is Majik 3D?
          Majik 3D is the fifth, and hopefully final, distinguishable
          incarnation of Majik. All of Majik's [32]predecessors have been
          essentially MUDs, Majik4 being a roguelike, but Majik 3D is a
          real 3-dimensional rpg that uses a real 3D engine. At the
          moment Majik 3D is under heavy development.
          
   2.4. When will Majik 3D be open to the public?
          Unknown. It will probably take months, even years. Look at our
          [33]milestone plan to get some idea where we are going and
          where we are within next few months.
          
   2.5. Who are the developers of Majik 3D?
          The people responsible for the base code of Majik 3D are listed
          below:
          
          [34]Tommi "Namhas" Leino ([35]namhas@majik.netti.fi)
          [36]Jari "Dazzt" Saukkonen ([37]dazzt@majik.netti.fi)
          [38]Atte "Yorkaturr" Koivula ([39]yorkaturr@majik.netti.fi)
          [40]Otso "Harum" Mäkinen ([41]harum@majik.netti.fi)
          
          There are also [42]numerous designers who are designing the
          world among other things, and doing miscellanious things apart
          from coding.
          
   2.6. Does Majik 3D have a homepage?
          Yes, the URL for Majik's homepage is: [43]http://majik.netti.fi
          
   2.7. Do you need my help?
          Most of you who imagine that Majik is just like any other MUD
          are frequently asking if we accept more wizards or builders.
          The answer is simply: we do not. One of [44]Majik3's worst
          mistakes was that we had just too much developers in relation
          to coordination and we will not repeat that mistake. It is
          easier to organize a project worked on by a handful of active
          and experienced developers with straight plans than a horde of
          100 (yes, we really had 100!) wanna-be coders who just wanted
          to code something "neat" just for fun, not taking it seriously
          at all.
          
          However, we are in need of people capable of doing computer
          graphics, world design and we are always looking for new
          dedicated and skilled developers to join our small development
          team. Also, if you don't want to sell your soul for the
          project, you can help by suggesting ideas, sending bug reports,
          fixing bugs in the client by sending patches (show us that
          there is some reason for the client being Open Source!) and by
          for example correcting the many spelling mistakes in these
          pages. Use your imagination. And remember, when you found a
          bug, do report it immediately and do not wait that someone else
          will report it anyways. They may not. For a while we had our
          Win32 port of the client in a condition that it didn't work at
          all (there were files missing), approx. 500 users downloaded it
          and only one of them dare to report such a fatal bug when a
          week has passed already.
          
          The address for offering help is the usual,
          [45]majik@majik.netti.fi.
          
   2.8. What is the difference between WorldForge (former Altima) and
          Majik?
          WorldForge: The WorldForge Project germinated via Slashdot 10
          months ago with an idea to create a roleplaying game system,
          focusing on freedom and playability. It wouldn't be just a 2D
          or 3D game; it could be playable using with various frontends
          from 2D text-based to true 3D frontend. Anyone could start a
          server and in fact there would actually be many servers, each
          with unique maps, histories, creatures, rulesets and legends.
          Shortly: The WorldForge is a project to create a base system
          for roleplaying games, which enables anyone to create new
          worlds on new servers offering various kinds of 2D and 3D
          frontends. You could say it is a net-RPG-toolkit, not a
          net-RPG.
          
          Majik: The Majik Project began in 1995 with an idea to create
          an online roleplaying world, focusing on realism, credibility
          and most of all: roleplayability. The project begun its journey
          as a simple text-based MUD and tried all the possible frontends
          before discovering true 3D frontend as the best choice. All of
          the previously tried frontends were inadequate. The 3D wasn't
          selected because of it would be beautiful, it was selected
          because it was not as restrictive as the others. How could one
          see for miles from a top of a mountain if only using a 2D-based
          client? Also, in the Majik there could be only one server, with
          one large, well-designed and dynamic world, where the players
          themselves could modify the rules for their liking. There are
          no restrictions. For example, if player killing becomes a
          nuisance, the players could group together and punish all the
          player killers. Not only by allowing players to modify rules
          they could change the world and its history by merely
          roleplaying their character. If one burns a house in a city, it
          will remain burned. If one kills an NPC, it will remain dead
          and if one builds a city it will be there until destroyed by
          someone. Shortly: The Majik Project strives to create not a
          system for creating roleplaying worlds, which is what
          WorldForge aims at, but is a concentrated effort to create one
          complete and evolving roleplaying world.
          
   2.9. How much will Majik cost to play, or will it be free?
          Majik is totally free of charge until it is so big that we must
          distribute it using CDs and at that point the medium will be
          the only factor determining the price.
       ______________________________________________________________
     
   3.1. Where can I get the client?
          Right now there is no client you could use for playing Majik.
          However, if you want to participate bug-testing,
          portability-fixing, even the development or just want to see
          how it looks right now, you can download the client from our
          [46]download page.
          
   3.2. What platforms does the client support?
          The client is primarily developed under Linux and it is ported
          to Windows (95/98/NT) and in the future will be hopefully
          ported to all the architectures and operating systems supported
          by [47]The Mesa 3-D graphics library.
          
   3.3. Is the client source available?
          Yes and no. The Majik 3D client's source code is now GPL'ed and
          is available for public download from our [48]ftp server.
          However, the server's source code will not be available
          because:
          
         1. There is no apparent gain for opening the server's source,
            unlike with the client.
         2. We wouldn't want to see people taking the source and starting
            up customized servers for their friends. We see this as waste
            of resources. Actually if they would have the source, they
            would of course like to start their own servers just to test
            the thing and without even having to open their network
            connection. This would lead in a situation where there is 100
            Majik servers up and running when they could all be forced to
            be in an one big server. I think it is better to have 1000
            users on one server than 10 users per server.
         3. We believe in centralized development more than distributed
            in a project such as this. We are doing a consistent world
            more than a generic game engine for everyone's use.
            
   3.4. Does the client have any special hardware requirements?
          If you want to use the best detail level you will need a 3D
          card, otherwise the graphics will be just too slow. However, it
          is possible to reduce the detail levels so it is actually
          possible to run Majik on systems without additional 3D
          hardware.
