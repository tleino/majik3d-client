       ______________________________________________________________
     
   2.1. What is Majik?
          Majik is a project to create an online role-playing environment
          set in a complete and ever-evolving medieval fantasy world with
          help of modern 3D-technology.
          
   2.2. What is a MURPE?
          MURPE stands for Multi-User Role-Playing Environment.
          
   2.3. What is Majik 3D?
          Majik 3D is the fifth, and hopefully final, distinguishable
          incarnation of Majik. All of Majik's [34]predecessors have been
          essentially MUDs, the fourth being a roguelike, but Majik 3D is
          a 3-dimensional RPG, that uses a real hardware-accelerated 3D
          engine. At the moment Majik 3D is under heavy development.
          
   2.4. When will Majik 3D be open to the public?
          Unknown. It will probably take months, even years. Look at our
          [35]milestone plan to get some idea where we are going and
          where we are within next few months.
          
   2.5. Who are the developers of Majik 3D?
          The people responsible for the base code of Majik 3D are listed
          below:
          
          [36]Tommi "Namhas" Leino ([37]namhas@majik.netti.fi)
          [38]Jari "Dazzt" Saukkonen ([39]dazzt@majik.netti.fi)
          [40]Atte "Yorkaturr" Koivula ([41]yorkaturr@majik.netti.fi)
          [42]Otso "Harum" Mäkinen ([43]harum@majik.netti.fi)
          
          There are also [44]numerous designers who are designing the
          world among other things, and doing miscellanious things apart
          from coding.
          
   2.6. Does Majik 3D have a homepage?
          Yes, the URL for Majik's homepage is: [45]http://majik.netti.fi
          
   2.7. Do you need my help?
          Most of you who imagine that Majik is just like any other MUD
          are frequently asking if we accept more wizards or builders.
          The answer is simply: we do not. One of [46]Majik3's worst
          mistakes was that we had just too much developers in relation
          to coordination and we will not repeat that mistake. It is
          easier to organize a project worked on by a handful of active
          and experienced developers with straight plans than a horde of
          100 (yes, we really had 100!) wanna-be coders who just wanted
          to code something "neat" just for fun, not taking it seriously
          at all.
          
          However, we are in need of people capable of doing computer
          graphics, world design and we are always looking for new
          dedicated and skilled developers to join our small development
          team. Also, if you don't want to sell your soul for the
          project, you can help by suggesting ideas, sending bug reports,
          fixing bugs in the client by sending patches (show us that
          there is some reason for the client being Open Source!) and by
          for example correcting the many spelling mistakes in these
          pages. Use your imagination. And remember, when you found a
          bug, do report it immediately and do not wait that someone else
          will report it anyways. They may not. For a while we had our
          Win32 port of the client in a condition that it didn't work at
          all (there were files missing), approx. 500 users downloaded it
          and only one of them dare to report such a fatal bug when a
          week has passed already.
          
          The address for offering help is the usual,
          [47]majik@majik.netti.fi.
          
   2.8. What is the difference between WorldForge (former Altima) and
          Majik?
          WorldForge: WorldForge's approach is not to create a single
          game, but instead a flexible framework that can support a
          variety of different kinds of servers, clients, rule sets,
          worlds, and graphical "looks".
          
          Majik: The Majik Project strives to create not a system for
          creating roleplaying worlds, which is what WorldForge aims at,
          but is a concentrated effort to create one complete and
          evolving roleplaying world.
          
   2.9. How much will Majik cost to play, or will it be free?
          Majik is totally free of charge until it is so big that we must
          distribute it using CDs and at that point the medium will be
          the only factor determining the price.
          
   2.10. Why did you chose 3D, aren't there easier alternatives?
          A very common question. It seems almost everyone thinks that
          making a complete 3D world is much more difficult and
          time-consuming task than making a 2D world, but in fact it is
          quite the opposite. In a 2D client, every tile, character, etc.
          needs to be drawn by a graphic artist, and the code for LOS
          (line of sight) and other such things can get rather
          complicated while they are a matter of course in a 3D world.
          Majik's 3D client doesn't even need excessive graphics, most of
          them is done by the code itself. The screenshots available of
          the current client program are all done without any aid of a
          graphic artist. Now, after you see that a 3D world can survive
          without a horde of graphic artists and is generally easier to
          implement, consider the possibilities and limitations, which
          one do you prefer: to climb up a mountain, turn to face
          whatever direction and see for miles or to see a flat world
          from an constant isometric angle? :)
          
   2.11. Why make Majik when other, similar projects are already
          underway?
          You should rather be asking why have other projects been
          started when Majik was already being developed? The development
          of Majik begun in 1995, its only competitors then being
          text-based MUDs. The developers started the project because
          they wanted to make something with more depth and purpose than
          mindless monster-killing that goes on in most MUDs even today.
          The purpose of Majik has always been to provide an actual,
          working roleplaying enviroment that would be completely
          player-controlled and self-sustaining, without the need of
          outside administration and control. The actions of players can
          cause significant changes in the history, enviroment and even
          geography of various areas and races, unlike in most MUDs where
          only the "gods" and implementors can make changes to the world.
          When Majik begun there were no similar projects (and is not yet
          either), if there would have been one, we would have joined the
          project to avoid reinventing the wheel which seems so popular
          habit in Open Source world nowadays, waste of resouces I say.
       ______________________________________________________________
     
   3.1. Where can I get the client?
          Right now there is no client you could use for playing Majik.
          However, if you want to participate bug-testing,
          portability-fixing, even the development or just want to see
          how it looks right now, you can download the client from our
          [48]download page.
          
   3.2. What platforms does the client support?
          The client is primarily developed under Linux and it is ported
          to Win32 (95/98/NT) and Solaris. In the future it will be
          hopefully ported to all the architectures and operating systems
          supported by [49]The Mesa 3-D graphics library.
          
   3.3. Is the client's source code available?
          Yes, it is available under the GNU Public License from our FTP
          server. To us it seems beneficial that other people are able to
          port the client freely to all systems and make small changes
          and corrections without our constant intervention. The server's
          source code, on the other hand, is not, and will not be,
          available to the public, because having it available without
          control wouldn't have any apparent gain (unlike with the
          client) and it would, with a time, lead into unnecessary
          fragmentation and thus making it harder to maintain centralized
          development with a clear, consistent goal. This arrangement
          doesn't restrict you in any way, if you want to play with the
          source, you just have to send us mail, join the development
          team and you have full access to our CVS tree.
          
   3.4. Does the client have any special hardware requirements?
          If you want to use the best detail level you will need a 3D
          card, otherwise the graphics will be just too slow. However, it
          is possible to reduce the detail levels so it is actually
          possible to run Majik on systems without additional 3D
          hardware.
