Introduction
------------

Before trying this software make sure that you have browsed through the FAQ
(http://www.majik3d.org/faq.html) and understand that the software is
available only for testing -- playing the actual game is not yet possible.

As the game is available for testing, we mean it too and expect you to give
us your feedback and bug reports. It is also strongly recommended that you
join the mailing lists and share your opinitions with the other users and
help the new users when they have problems, or even join the development
team if you feel like you have the potential to do so.

If you find a bug that has not been answered in the FAQ do report it
immediately to majik@majik3d.org or directly to majik-users mailing list (so
the other users could see it too) and do not wait that someone else will do
it, they may not. Also, if you have anything else to tell, just tell it!

http://www.majik3d.org/archive.html is the address to join the mailing lists.
It would be good to at least join the majik-announce so you will get
announcements of new versions directly to your mailbox. You will not receive
any other crap by joining -announce, except an occasional call for a
convention.

Release Notes for 0.4.0pre
--------------------------

It has been a long time since last release. We all have been quite busy with
one way or another. The codebase has also been under extensive changes.
Because this is a 'pre'-release you can expect bugs and/or crashes. Use at
your own risks.

A brief list of the most important changes since 0.3.0:
	
    *   New physical-based sky model (introduced in 0.3.1)
    *   Rewritten landscape code, for increased performance
    *   Rewritten server code, now relying even more on python
    *   1st person mode (introduced in 0.3.1)
    *   The game seems to be slow (despite the frame rate counter on the
        lower-left corner) because the current movement code requires
        transmission to and from server for each movement. Thus, the movement
        rate is limited by your network connection.

Currently known bugs and features include:

    *   Because of plib, sky is not fully visible unless you disable fog.
        This should be fixed in forthcoming plib releases.
    *   Terrain looks blocky because it's always in it's lowest detail level.
        The error approximation function used to select the LOD level hasn't
        been coded yet (I didn't feel like start kludging it in christmas eve).
    *   Win32 version crashes when you press 'ok' in about box.
    *   New server isn't yet in public use.

Installation
------------

If you have got a pre-compiled binary version of the game the installation
should be fairly easy. You have already unpacked the archive, now you just
have to execute the executable.

Before you rush to see the client in action, you might want see if you
can change something in the configuration file. This is a recommended
step to do if you do not have or can't use 3D hardware acceleration. It is
easy, just open the "majik3d.ini" ("majikrc" in the UNIX version) file and
replace 1's with 0's if you want to disable some feature. For example by
disabling textures and setting the screen size to 320x200 you can get a
nice boost in the speed.

After you are satisfied with the configuration file, you just have to open
the "majik3d.exe" (UNIX users do "./majik") executable either by clicking
its icon in the same folder as is this README file or alternatively type
its name in your DOS box, shell or wherever and a new window should open,
asking you to enter your name. If not, then you have a problem and should
call for help, if you can't find the answer in the FAQ.

The Windows version supports all the 3D hardware accelerators that are fully
OpenGL-compliant. That means almost all accelerator cards should work, except
perhaps the most popular ones: Voodoo 1 and 2. The Voodoo 3 works fine. The
UNIX version does support even these if using Mesa compiled with glide
support.

For the UNIX versions make sure you have all the required libraries installed
correctly. If you are unable to run the pre-compiled binary, please consult
the next chapter and compile the sources by yourself.

Compiling the sources
---------------------

You should be able to compile these sources on any platform supported by
the Mesa 3D library (http://www.mesa3d.org) or OpenGL with minor or no
changes, but these installation instructions apply only to the UNIX-like
environments that include the GNU tools.

  1. Make sure you have all the required libraries installed with their
     development SDKs. You can get the libraries from here:

       ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/MesaLib-3.0.tar.gz
       ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/MesaDemos-3.0.tar.gz
       http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/plib/dist/plib-1.0.20.tar.gz
       http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut-3.7.tar.gz

     You do not have to install Mesa if you have a real OpenGL support in 
     your box (SGI for example) and you do not need to get glut-3.7.tar.gz
     if you install MesaDemos-3.0.tar.gz because it includes the GLUT.

  2. Compile the sources:

     $ ./configure
     $ make

  3. Execute the binary as instructed in the previous chapter.

Playing the game
----------------

As said above, you can't play the game yet. You can only walk around, talk
to strangers and to run away from evil bugs who are trying to crash your
client. You might however want to know how to even do that, look below:

  8           = move forward         4           = turn left
  6           = turn right           2           = move backward
  x           = exit                 w           = wireframe mode
  <insert>    = hide/reveal menu bar <tab>       = open a prompt to talk
  <f1>        = 3rd person           <f2>        = 1st person
  <f12>       = take a "screenshot"  +           = look up (1st person only)
  -           = look down (1st person only)

That's all folks.
