Foreword
--------

This is a CVS snapshot of 0.4.0 release, the last GPL-licensed release
of a client program for Majik 3D MMORPG game, with minor modifications.

The development of this project continued after the 0.4.0 release, but
it was no longer GPL-licensed: the development team moved to Taika
Technologies, Ltd. to further develop technologies originally pioneered
in the Majik 3D MMORPG server, and to redevelop the client program by
leveraging proprietary technologies such as SurRender 3D visualization
library and SurRender Umbra visibility optimizer developed by Hybrid
Holding, Ltd.

In other words, this repository contains legacy source code, but may be
of historical interest to someone.

Please note, most of the URLs no longer exist: please use archive.org
from around year 2000 to access the content. Also, the e-mail addresses
no longer work. For contacting the original development team, you can
try namhas at gmail.com.

Introduction
------------

Before trying this software make sure that you have browsed through the FAQ
(http://www.majik3d.org/faq.html) and understand that the software is
available only for testing -- playing the actual game is not yet possible.

As the game is available for testing, we mean it too and expect you to give
us your feedback and bug reports. It is also strongly recommended that you
join the mailing lists and share your opinitions with the other users and
help the new users when they have problems, or even join the development
team if you feel like you have the potential to do so.

If you find a bug that has not been answered in the FAQ do report it
immediately to majik@majik3d.org or directly to majik-users mailing list (so
the other users could see it too) and do not wait that someone else will do
it, they may not. Also, if you have anything else to tell, just tell it!

http://www.majik3d.org/archive.html is the address to join the mailing lists.
It would be good to at least join the majik-announce so you will get
announcements of new versions directly to your mailbox. You will not receive
any other crap by joining -announce, except an occasional call for a
convention.

Release Notes for 0.4.0
-----------------------

It has been a long time since last release. We all have been quite busy with
one way or another. The codebase has also been under extensive changes. The
0.4.0 release was meant to provide a solid base for further development and
it should have the landscape, sky and the movement fully working so we could
concentrate on more fun things in the future. This release is really a bare
base without anything too fancy. The 0.4.x releases will then fix the bugs
and add improve the existing features, such as making a better landscape
texturing engine, try to make a real forest with a crystal as a landmark on
the middle of it and a chatting system the users could use for real. This
release doesn't support vertex coloring in the landscape and thus it doesn't
work too good for those without a 3D acceleration. It might be however fixed
in the future.

A brief list of the most important changes since 0.3.0:
	
    *   New physical-based sky model (introduced in 0.3.1).
    *   Rewritten landscape code, for increased performance.
    *   Rewritten server code, now relying even more on Python.
    *   Some internal code clean up and a lot of bug fixing.
    *   1st person mode (introduced in 0.3.1).
    *   New movement code, for less bandwidth usage.
    *   New smoother camera.
    *   The landscape's texture is now dynamically generated by the code,
        resulting in a more realistic texturing that takes the landscape's
        shape in account.
    *   Some fir trees are now scattered around.
    *   A new player object with a face.

Currently known bugs and features include:

    *   Because of PLIB, sky is not fully visible unless you disable fog.
        This should be fixed in forthcoming plib releases.
    *   Terrain looks blocky because it's always in it's lowest detail level.
        The error approximation function used to select the LOD level hasn't
        been coded yet.
    *   The visibility in the landscape code is not yet controllable.
    *   Win32 version crashes when you press 'ok' in about box.
    *   The texture generator is not as good as it could be, but it is a
        start.

Installation
------------

If you have got a pre-compiled binary version of the game the installation
should be fairly easy. You have already unpacked the archive, now you just
have to execute the executable.

Before you rush to see the client in action, you might want see if you
can change something in the configuration file. This is a recommended
step to do if you do not have or can't use 3D hardware acceleration. It is
easy, just open the "majik3d.ini" ("majikrc" in the UNIX version) file and
replace 1's with 0's if you want to disable some feature. For example by
disabling textures and setting the screen size to 320x200 you can get a
nice boost in the speed.

After you are satisfied with the configuration file, you just have to open
the "majik3d.exe" (UNIX users do "./majik") executable either by clicking
its icon in the same folder as is this README file or alternatively type
its name in your DOS box, shell or wherever and a new window should open,
asking you to enter your name. If not, then you have a problem and should
call for help, if you can't find the answer in the FAQ.

The Windows version supports all the 3D hardware accelerators that are fully
OpenGL-compliant. That means almost all accelerator cards should work, except
perhaps the most popular ones: Voodoo 1 and 2. The Voodoo 3 works fine. The
UNIX version does support even these if using Mesa compiled with glide
support.

For the UNIX versions make sure you have all the required libraries installed
correctly. If you are unable to run the pre-compiled binary, please consult
the next chapter and compile the sources by yourself.

Compiling the sources
---------------------

If you compile directly from the repository, first run

  ./autogen.sh

You should be able to compile these sources on any platform supported by
the Mesa 3D library (http://www.mesa3d.org) or OpenGL with minor or no
changes, but these installation instructions apply only to the UNIX-like
environments that include the GNU tools.

  1. Make sure you have all the required libraries installed with their
     development SDKs. You can get the libraries from here:

       ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/MesaLib-3.0.tar.gz
       ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/MesaDemos-3.0.tar.gz
       http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/plib/dist/plib-1.0.20.tar.gz
       http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut-3.7.tar.gz

     You do not have to install Mesa if you have a real OpenGL support in 
     your box (SGI for example) and you do not need to get glut-3.7.tar.gz
     if you install MesaDemos-3.0.tar.gz because it includes the GLUT.

  2. Compile the sources:

     $ ./configure
     $ make

  3. Execute the binary as instructed in the previous chapter.

Playing the "game"
------------------

As said above, you can't play the game yet. You can only walk around, talk
to strangers and to run away from evil bugs who are trying to crash your
client. You might however want to know how to even do that, look below:

  8, <up>     = move forward         4, <left>   = turn left
  6, <right>  = turn right           2, <down>   = move backward
  x           = exit                 w           = wireframe mode
  <insert>    = hide/reveal menu bar <tab>       = open a prompt to talk
  <f1>        = 3rd person           <f2>        = 1st person
  <f12>       = take a "screenshot"

You can use mouse in 1st person mode to turn around.
