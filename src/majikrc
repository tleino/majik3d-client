# majikrc
# 
# This is a sample configuration file for Majik 3D client. It is
# usually located at ~/.majikrc, but it is also searched from /etc and
# the current directory.

# If you have no hardware acceleration you should set screen_width 
# to 320, height to 200, bpp to 8, notexture to 1, nomouse to 1 
# nomousetrap to 1, nofog to 1, nosmooth to 1, nomenu to 1, fullscreen 
# to 0, lod to 7, debug and protocol_debug to 0.  Otherwise the default
# values will do.
