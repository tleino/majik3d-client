# 
# This is a sample configuration file for Majik 3D client. It is
# usually located at ~/.majikrc, but it is also searched from /etc and
# the current directory.

# to 320, height to 200, bpp to 8, notexture to 1, nomouse to 1 
# nomousetrap to 1, nofog to 1, nosmooth to 1, nomenu to 1, fullscreen 
# to 0, lod to 7 (or even smaller!), debug and protocol_debug to 0. 
# Otherwise the default values will do.
